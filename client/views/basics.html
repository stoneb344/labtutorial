          <h1>Programming Fundamentals</h1>
          <p class="small-font">
            Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that focuses on the
            creation and use of objects, their states, and behaviors. Before we
            discuss OOP any further, we should first discuss more basic structures
            and principles. Create an account on
            <a href="http://repl.it" target="_blank">repl.it</a>. Fill out your
            profile (or click the "skip" link), then hit the "Start Coding Now"
            button. In the search bar, look up "Java" then click on the first result.
            You should be directed to a page that looks like this:
            The box outlined in red is where you will write your code, and the box
            outlined in blue will display it's output.
            <img src="/repl.png" alt="repl.png">
            Right now, the concepts you will learn are more important than the
            language. Java is merely a vehicle in this tutorial. It is strongly
            recommended that you emulate any examples given.

            Click the green "Run" button above the box that is outlined in red in
            the above image. In the box outlined blue, you should see some output
            that looks like this: <img src="/hello_output.png" alt="hello_output.png">
            Notice the contents inside of the green box. That corresponds to this
            code: <img src="/hello_code.png" alt="hello_code.png"> Line 3 makes use
            of what is known as a "print statement." This is what is responsible
            for producing the output in the green box.
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;System.out.println("Hello world!");&nbsp;</span>
            prints the contents of the parentheses to the console. Go ahead
            and try it! Replace <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;"Hello world!"&nbsp;</span>
            with whatever you would like. Be sure to include enveloping double quotes
            though. Now, just above line 3, insert the code <br>
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String myVar;&nbsp;</span>.
            Congratulations on declaring your first variable! Replace the contents
            of the print statement's parentheses with your variable's name. Your
            code should look like this: <img src="/declare_variable.png" alt="declare_variable.png">
            Now click the "Run" button to run your code. Notice that your console
            returns a red error message. This is because there is nothing
            stored inside of myVar. The message is telling you that you
            have not initialized your variable, but you are asking the console to
            print whatever is store in myVar.
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;myVar = "Hello world!";&nbsp;</span>
            below the line where you declared myVar. The
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span> operator assigns
            the material on the right side of it to the variable named on its left.
            Now run your code again. The console should print "Hello world!" just
            as it did in the green box earlier. If you would like, you can combine
            declaration and initialization of your variable into a single line,
            which looks like this: <br>
            <img src="/combined_variable.png" alt="combined_variable.png"> <br>
            However, variable declaration and variable initialization are separate
            concepts. To emphasize this distinction, I recommend you declare and
            intialize variables on separate lines for practice (at least until you
            graduate from LabTut). Note that variable declaration must always come
            before initialization. This is because programs execute sequentially
            top-to-bottom, line by line. Now that you know a variable simply stores
            values, we should talk about what types of values you can store.

        <div id="types" class="section scrollspy tech-text-padding">
          <h2>Data Types</h2>
          <p class="small-font">
            Java is a strongly-typed language, meaning that you must provide the
            <span class="bold-text">data type</span> (hereforth referred to as a "type")
            of a variable when you declare it. A variable's type determines the
            contents it can store. For example, a variable of type
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span> can only
            hold integers. In the previous section, you declared a
            <span class="bold-text">String</span> variable (named myVar) that held
            the <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String&nbsp;</span>, <br>
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;"Hello World!"&nbsp;</span>.
            Java supports 8 primitive types. The ones that I recommend you become
            immediately familiar with right are
            <span class="bold-text">int</span>, <span class="bold-text">double</span>,
            and <span class="bold-text">boolean</span>. The difference between a
            primitive type and a reference type, such as a
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String&nbsp;</span> &mdash; notice
            that it is capitalized, as is with all reference types &mdash; are the
            way in which the values are stored in memory. For now, this is not an
            important detail. We will now talk about each specific type mentioned
            above. <br>
            An <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span> variable
            holds integers. A double variable holds decimal numbers. A boolean variable
            holds one of two value: true or false. Now lets try these out.
            Below, the line where you declared myVar, declare (1) an
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span> variable
            named intVar, (2) a <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;double&nbsp;</span>
            variable named doubleVar, and (3) a
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;boolean&nbsp;</span> variable
            named boolVar. Then on a separate line, initialize them with values
            of your choice. Keep in mind that each respective variable will
            only accept a value that fits the definition of its type! Hint: Leave
            out the enveloping double quotes! Those are only necassary for
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String&nbsp;</span>s. Your code
            should look something like this:
            <img src="/var_tutorial_code.png" alt="var_tutorial_code.png">
            However, the values for your variables could be different as long as
            they are appropriate to the type that the variable is declared as. For example,
            your intVar variable could be initialized to 2005 instead of 100 if
            you so desire. Now add print statements for each new variable of yours.
            To do this, use the one from earlier as a template &mdash; but replace
            myVar with the name of your new variables in each, like this:
            <img src="/print_statements.png" alt="print_statements.png"> <br>
            The console should print each variable on a different line. Now change myVar
            to contain the same number as intVar, but envelop in in double quotes.
            So if you set intVar as <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;100&nbsp;</span>,
            then set myVar to <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;"100"&nbsp;</span>.
            When you run your code again, you should see the number print twice.
            It will look identical. However, there is an important difference;
            the former is a <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String&nbsp;</span>,
            while the latter is an <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span>.
            We will clarify the significance of this distinction later in the
            <a href="Classes and Objects">Class and Objects</a> section. You can jump to it by using the content navigator
            on the right side of the window.

          <h2>Literals</h2>
          <p class="small-font">
            A <span class="bold-text">literal</span> is a value that is to be
            interpreted literally -- in other words, exactly as it is written. Lets
            write code for two variables, If you look back at the previous section,
            you will find that we have been using these to literals initialize variables.
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;100&nbsp;</span> and
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;3.14&nbsp;</span> and
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;true&nbsp;</span> and
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;"Hello world!"&nbsp;</span> <br>
            are all literals. We can either place the literal values or the variables
            inside the print statement, but the result will be the same. So why
            use a variable? The variable can hold a value for future re-use, among
            other applications. For example, if you needed to use the value
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;26.65378201&nbsp;</span>
            in your code multiple times, you may wish to store the value in a variable
            and re-use the variable as many times as needed instead of trying to
            retype the literal over and over. That would be tedious and error prone.
            Among other uses, variables can be used to track changes to values
            stored in variables.

          <p class="small-font">
            The same way that the english language is bound by rules defining sentence
            structure, code will only compile and run if it is written according
            to the rules of the specific programming language. For example: in Java,
            every statement needs to end with a semi-colon. Erase the semi-colon
            from the end of any statement in your code, then try to run it. Your
            console will produce another red error message attempting to guide you
            towards resolution. Often times, these errors can be cryptic. However,
            somebody has likely run into the same problem. That makes google your
            best friend. Often times, the exact issue you are encountering has a
            solution that has been posted online. <br>
            You MUST know and follow the rules of the language you are programming
            in. While you are first learning, you may find that some "unsolvable"
            and "mysterious" issues preventing your code from running are syntactic
            in nature. We will learn Java's syntax as we continue through the tutorial
            and given aspects become relevant. For now, just know that every statement
            must end with a semi-colon.

        <h2>Operators</h2>

          Erase everything that you have added, so your code looks like this:
          <img src="/empty_class.png" alt="empty_class.png">
          Everything that you write should go within the inner most opening and
          closing brackets. For now, think of the empty space between them as an
          "empty template" in which you can inject code. Now create two variables:
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span> and
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;b&nbsp;</span> which are both
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span>s. Initialize
          them with any (integer) values of your choice. Then write a print statement
          which adds the two variables. Your code should look very similar (or identical)
          this: <img src="/add_variables.png" alt="add_variables.png"> <br>
          You will
          notice that console outputs the sum of your two variables. In the the
          example above, it will print 3. The
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;+&nbsp;</span> operator adds the values
          on either side of it. In this case,
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span> and
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;b&nbsp;</span>. If you would like,
          you can use literals instead of variables with this operator (and many
          others). So what is an operator? An <span class="bold-text">operator</span>
          is a construct that manipulates operands or transforms values. An operand
          is simply the object of manipulation.
          Here is a list of Arithematic operators:

          <table>
            <tr>
              <td>&nbsp;+</td>
              <td>
                <span class="bold-text">Addition</span> adds the values on either side of the operator

          </table>
          <br>

          There are many more operators that serve a variety of other functions.
          The internet is an extensive educational resource. Use it. The ability
          to self-help is a rare but crucial skill... and in the world of programming,
          it is a necessity. Here is a link to a page on
          <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_basic_operators.htm" target="_blank">tutorialspoint</a>
          which you can use to learn more about other kinds of operators. For now,
          I strongly recommend that you focus on arithematic, relational, and the
          first three assignment operators listed. Self-help means that you will
          have to learn about boolean expressions on your own in order to understand
          relational operators. If this proves too difficult, go on to the next
          section, and then come back here after completing it. <br>
          Play around with operators to force different types to interact. What works?
          What does not? Here is a list of some things for you to try. But don't
          stop here... experimentation facilitates comprehension! <br>
          1. Add an int and a double. Do they add? Does the result print as an int
          or a double? <br>
          2. Divide an int or double by 0. What happens? <br>

        <p>If/Else Statements</p>
        <p class="small-font">
          The boolean expression <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;a &lt; 5&nbsp;</span>
          will evaluate to true if <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span>
          is any value less than 5. Otherwise, it will evaluate to false. You can
          verify this with a print statement. So how is this useful? We can make
          chunks of code execute conditionally using an
          <span class="bold-text">if/else statement</span>. Inspect the following
          code. <br>
          <img src="/if.png" alt="if.png"> <br>
          Lines 6-8 demonstrate the structure of an "if statement" (which is essentially
          just half of an if/else statement). Line 6 uses the keyword
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;if&nbsp;</span> followed by open
          and closed parentheses. A <span class="bold-text">keyword</span> is a
          word that is reserved by the programming language with a predefined
          meaning. These words cannot be used as variable names (or the like) because
          they have predetermined functionality. Inside of the parentheses is a
          boolean expression. If the conditions inside of it are true, then the
          code inside of the opening and closing brackets will execute. Otherwise,
          the enclosed code will be skipped. In the previous example,
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span> is less than 5,
          as it was given a value of 1. Therefore the print statement on line 7 will
          execute. Were it given a value of 7, then that code would be overlooked
          upon execution. Using the keyword <span class="italic-text">else</span>,
          we can insert a block of code to be run if the condition(s) for the "if
          statement" code are false. While an "if statement" can exist independently,
          an "else statement" cannot. This should be intuitive. Check below: <br>
          <img src="/else.png" alt="else.png"> <br>
          We have defined conditions inside of parentheses for the "if statement"
          code, but we have not done so for the "else statement" code. That is because
          the conditions for the "else statment" are implicitly defined. The code
          inside of the "else statement" will only run if the conditions for the
          "if statement" are false.  Note that the code to be run in this case is also
          between opening and closing brackets. Congratulations on writing your
          first if/else statement! Now, what if we want to specify that multiple
          conditions must be met in order for a block of code to be executed? We
          can use the <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;&&&nbsp;</span> and
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;||&nbsp;</span> operators. Here
          is an example: <br>
          <img src="/or.png" alt="or.png"> <br>
          For the code in the "if statement" to be executed, <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span>
          must be less than 5 OR <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;b&nbsp;</span>
          must be equal to 10. Only one of those conditions need be true because
          we used the "OR" operator. This should look familiar if you explored the
          link provided in the <a href="#operators">Operators</a> section. If we
          wanted to specify that both <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span>
          must be less than AND <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;b&nbsp;</span>
          must be equal to 10, then we should use the "AND" operator instead. Try
          replacing it yourself. When you do this, change the code inside of the
          "else statement" to print a corresponding message. Also note that
          <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;==&nbsp;</span> is used instead
          of the <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span> sign. This
          is because the latter is used only for assignment (i.e. initializing a
          variable), while the former is used for checking equality. Remember
          this detail. On your own, you should learn about "else if" and "switch"
          statements.

      <p>Loops and Iteration</p>
      <p class="small-font">
        If there is a chunk of code that must be executed repeatedly, loops become
        a convenient feature. In fact, you will find that loops are quite ubiquitous
        in computer programming. Rather than trying to endlessly copy/paste your
        code, you can insert it inside of a loop which will continuously execute
        that code until some specified condition is satisfied.
        We shall begin our discussion with the <span class="bold-text">for loop</span>.
        A for loop will execute as many times as specified. Look at the following
        graphic: <br>
        <img src="/empty_for_loop.png" alt="empty_for_loop.png"> <br>
        The header of the loop has 3 important components following the keyword
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;for&nbsp;</span> that are each underlined
        with a different color.<br>
        1. Underlined in green is the
        <span class="italic-text green-text">initialization condition</span>,
        which sets the starting point for the loop. You may either declare and
        initialize an <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span>
        here (as done above), or use an existing one. While you can use other
        number types (i.e. a <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;double&nbsp;</span>)
        it is a good idea to stick with <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span>s.
        <br>
        2. Underlined in red is the <span class="italic-text red-text">test expression</span>.
        This is a boolean expression which will be tested against using the
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span> from your initialization
        condition. The loop will continue to run until this expression is false.
        <br>
        3. Underlined in blue is the <span class="italic-text blue-text">update statement</span>.
        This indicates to the loop how to change the value of your variable. In
        the example above the <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;++&nbsp;</span>
        operator tells the loop to increment the variable by 1. <br>
        So let's put it all together. <span class="green-text">The loop above
        begins with <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span> as 0</span>,
        <span class="blue-text">will add 1 to
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span> every iteration</span>,
        <span class="red-text">and cease iterating once
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span> is no longer less
        than 10 &mdash; in other words, when
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span> equals 10.</span>
        With some simple math, we find that the loop runs 10 times! Verify
        this yourself by inserting a print statement inside of the loop that prints
        the value of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>. Any
        code to be "looped over" should replace the whitespace between the
        opening and closing brackets, as shown below. <br>
        <img src="/for_loop.png" alt="for_loop.png"> <br>
        Your console should ouput the numbers 0 through 9 on separate lines. Be
        careful with loops (of any kind)! If written poorly, they can iterate endlessly. Change
        your update statement to decrement instead in order to see this for yourself.
        Once your never ending loop starts, you will have to hit the "Stop" button
        to halt your code's execution. Also, keep in mind that you can use larger
        increments for your loop. The <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;++&nbsp;</span>
        and <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;--&nbsp;</span> operators
        add and subtract 1 respectively, but you can change the update statement
        to hold <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i + 5&nbsp;</span> or
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i - 3&nbsp;</span> or another number
        instead.<br>
        A <span class="bold-text">while loop</span> function similarly. Examine
        the graphic below, focusing on the code inside of the yellow box.
        <img src="/empty_while_loop.png" alt="empty_while_loop.png">
        The header of a while loop is simple. It is the keyword
       <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;while&nbsp;</span> followed by
        a boolean expression (underlined in light blue above). The loop will iterate
        continuously while the expression evaluates to true, and terminate only when
        it becomes false. The whitespace in this image represents the area where
        code should be inserted. Check the image below. <br>
        <img src="/while_loop.png" alt="while_loop.png"> <br>
        Inside the body of the loop, you will see that line 7 increments the
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;age&nbsp;</span> variable while
        line 8 prints its current value. Run this code. You will see that the value
        rises by 1 starting at 0 and ending 18. After that, the console no longer prints
        any output because the print statement is INSIDE of the loop, and the
        loop has terminated. But why? The "if statement" inside of the loop will
        change the value of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;isNotAdult&nbsp;</span>
        to false once the value of age reaches 18. Hence, the boolean expression
        has become false, terminating the loop. Note that if the boolean expression
        used as a test statement is false to begin with (maybe you initialized
        your variables with values that result in this), the loop will be skipped
        over entirely. Remember that the loop will only run while the boolean
        expression evaluates to true. If
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;isNotAdult&nbsp;</span> were initialized
        as <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;true&nbsp;</span>, this would be the case
        here. In some cases, you may want your loop to run at least one time so
        that you may enter the body of it regardless of such conditions. A
        <span class="bold-text">do while loop</span> does just that; the boolean
        expression is evaluated after the first iteration of the loop. You are
        encouraged to read about do while loops on your own.
        <br>
        There are two keywords which can override the normal execution of a loop.
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;break;&nbsp;</span> will terminate
        a loop and begin re-execution of your code just outside of it.
        <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;continue;&nbsp;</span> will cause
        the loop to jump to the next iteration immediately. These commands may
        not be too useful to you any time soon, but they are important to keep
        in the back of your mind. <br>

        What you have learned in this section is very foundational. As always,
        you are encouraged to play around with these structures and write your
        own simple programs with them! You will grasp them better if you do.

        <h2>Sample Project</h2>
        <p class="small-font">
          In the world of programming, concepts tend to come together once they
          are applied in some manner. We are going to write a short program called
          "FizzBuzz," which makes use of the concepts you have been learning.
        </p>
        <p>Specifications</p>
        <p class="small-font">
          1. The program should print integers 1-100 to the console, each on a
          separate line, but with the following exceptions: <br>
          2. Every number that is divisible by 3 should print "Fizz" instead.
          <br>
          3. Every number that is divisible by 5 should print "Buzz" instead.
          <br>
          4. Every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 should print "FizzBuzz" instead.
          <br>
          Stop here. You should spend 20-30 minutes thinking about the problem and trying
          to write the program on your own. Use google to discover a method for
          finding divisibility, and the sections above this one to get as far as
          you can independently. If you are unable to write the program, do not fret.
          We will go through it together once you have made your independent attempt.
          </p>
          <p>Instructions</p>
          <p class="small-font">
          Lets look at specification 1. How could we print one hundred sequential
          numbers? We could write one hundred print statements... or we could use
          a loop! Let's use a for loop to print 1-100 to the console. Try this yourself
          before clicking <a id="100-loop-btn" href="#">here</a> to see what it
          would look like! <br>
          <img id="100-loop" src="/1-100_loop.png" alt="1-100_loop.png">
          Now that we are successfully printing 1-100 to the console, we need to
          look at specifications 2, 3, and 4. How can we conditionally print "Fizz,"
          "Buzz," and "FizzBuzz" to the console? Using if/else statements! We'll
          need three of them to account for each circumstance. Use the modulus operator
          to check for divisibility. If x mod y
          (or <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;x % y&nbsp;</span>) returns
          0, then x is divisible by y, as there was no remainder from division.
          For example, 9 mod 3 returns 0. Hence 9 is divisible by 3 because 9 divided
          by 3 produces no remainder. Now try to write the three "if statements."
          Once you have done that, insert appropriate print statements into their
          respective bodies. Your code should look similar to <a id="err1-btn" href="#">this</a>.
          <img id="err1" src="/fizzbuzz_error1.png" alt="fizzbuzz_error1.png"> Run
          your code. You will find that there are several errors in the logic. <br>
          <img id="err1-output" src="/fizzbuzz_error1_output.png" alt="fizzbuzz_error1_output.png">
          Look at the green box. 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, so your code
          <span class="italic-text">should</span> omit the number 15 and fill its
          spot with "FizzBuzz" instead. However, it is not replacing numbers with
          "Fizz," "Buzz," or "FizzBuzz." It is simply printing them on the lines
          following the number (depending on its divisibility). If you examine the
          output, you will find that this issue occurs all throughout. Let's trace
          the code for the 15th iteration of the loop. <br>
          Line 4 prints the value of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>,
          which would be 15. <br>
          Lines 5-7 prints "Fizz" because <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>
          is divisible by 3. <br>
          Lines 8-10 print "Buzz" because <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>
          is divisible by 5. <br>
          And lastly, lines 11-13 print "FizzBuzz" because <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>
          is divisible by both 3 and 5. <br>
          This is why the green box contains so much unnecassary output. We have
          3 separate "if statements" so each conditional will be evaluated separately,
          and the corresponding print statement(s) will be executed given the requisite
          circumstances are fulfilled. Put another way, the code currently runs
          a linear path and checks each "if statement." We want a branching path
          where only a single correct option can be chosen per iteration. This can
          be achieved using "else if." Change the last two "if statements" to "else
          if statements." We must also account for line 4, which will unconditionally
          &mdash; and undesirably &mdash; print an integer value regardless of divisibility.
          Since we want <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>
          to print to the console only when none of the other conditions are met,
          we can move this line into the body of an "else statement." Your code
          should now look like <a id="almost-btn" href="#">this</a>:
          <img id="almost" src="/fizzbuzz_almost.png" alt="fizzbuzz_almost.png">
          Now run your code again. You will find that the output is still incorrect.
          While numbers that are exclusively multiples of 3 or 5 are now replacing
          themselves with "Fizz" or "Buzz" appropriately, numbers that are multiples
          of 15 &mdash; numbers divisible by 3 AND 5 &mdash; are printing "Fizz"
          even though they should print "FizzBuzz." Let's trace the code again for
          the 15th iteration of the loop.

          Lines 4-6 print "Fizz" because <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>
          is divisible by 3. But remember that your code is now a branching
          in such a way that only a single path can be taken per iteration? This
          is the problem, but also its solution. As mentioned earlier, programs
          execute sequentially. This means your code is executed line-by-line according
          to its natural chronology. Click <a id="almost-with-markup-btn" href="#">this</a>
          and inspect the following graphic: <br>
          <img id="almost-with-markup" src="/fizzbuzz_almost_with_markup.png" alt="fizzbuzz_almost_with_markup.png">
          During runtime, you will enter the body of the
          <span class="red-text">first conditional block</span> which your variable <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>
          satisfies the entry conditions of. It will then exit the entire control
          structure, even if there are other conditionals following it that would
          satisfy. So what would happen if you swapped the positions of the
          <span class="red-text">conditional block 1</span> with
          <span class="orange-text">conditional block 2</span>? Run your code. It
          will print "Buzz" because <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>
          (being 15) would still satisfy your "new" first conditional block and enter
          its body. After this, it will exit the whole control structure in its entirety
          without evaluating the boolean expressions of next three conditional blocks,
          the proceed to advance to the next iteration of the loop. But we need
          to print "FizzBuzz," not just "Buzz." So now swap the position of your
          "new" first conditional block with
          <span class="darkblue-text">conditional block 3</span>. Your code should
          now be identical to the "simple solution" posted below (or nearly so).
          Feel free to run it and check its output against the specifications. One
          new lesson to take from this sample project: when dealing with conditional
          structures, the order in which they are arranged is important depending
          on the context. Sometimes (like in this case) the most specific conditions
          should be placed ahead of the rest.

          <h2>Comments</h2>
          <p class="small-font">
            <span class="bold-text">Comments</span> are human-readable annotations
            of computer code that improve comprehensibility. They are ignored by
            compilers and interpreters (do not worry about what these are for now)
            and thus will not execute when your program is run. Single-line comments
            begin with <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;//&nbsp;</span>.
            They look like this:
            <img src="/single_comments.png" alt="single_comments.png"> <br>
            Multi-line comments (AKA block comments) begin with
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;/*&nbsp;</span> and end with
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;*/&nbsp;</span>. Anything between
            those two marks will be skipped over during execution.
            <img src="/block_comment.png" alt="block_comment.png"> <br>
            For styling purposes, asterisks have been planted at the beginnings of
            every line, but only the very first and last asterisks are actually
            required. Comments can be used to inactivate lines of code. Try writing
            a print statement inside of a comment. You will see that it does not
            manifest during execution. This can be a helpful detail when inspecting
            existing code for errors. For example, a section of code suspected of
            causing a specific error can be commented out to check if the error
            disappears when the program is run again. Assuming the error has vanished,
            you might be on to something. If not, you can just as easily uncomment
            the code to safely restore it. This is preferred over actually deleting
            large chunks of code which you may wish to reinstate in the future.
            <br>
            More importantly, comments provide documentation which may
            help other developers understand your code. It may
            even help you recall your own thought processes after returning to your
            code from a lengthy intermission. Quality documentation of your work
            is an important task and habit to undertake. But only document as much
            as needed. Excessive documentation can be difficult to sift through
            for important information. An example of unneeded documentation would
            be the single-line comments in the first image which narrate the declaration
            and initialization of variable <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span>.
            Every computer programmer knows what declaration and initialization
            are. If you need to briefly explain the purpose of an unintuitive
            variable or process, then you may choose to leave a comment.
            However, code should be self-documenting (as much as possible). You
            should strive to write code that could be easily understood by even
            a novice programmer, and comment only when necassary. For instance,
            variable names should be self-explanatory.

            Arrays and other data structures. Also mention off-by-1 "0 indexing" <br>
            An <span class="bold-text">array</span> is a collection of elements (of a specified type) which can
            each be accessed by an index. Look at the following graphic: <br>
            <img src="/array_markup.png" alt="array_markup.png"> <br>
            In red, the two square brackets (<span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;[]&nbsp;</span>) immediately following
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String&nbsp;</span> indicate
            the <span class="red-text">declaration of an array</span>. This is not
            limited to <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String&nbsp;</span>s;
            you may declare an array of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int&nbsp;</span>s
            or any other type. To do so, you would simply add trailing square brackets
            to the type in your declaration. For example,
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int[]&nbsp;</span>to declare
            an array of integers. However, a single array can only hold elements
            of the type declared. Initialization always takes the following form:
            comma-separated elements with opening and closing curly brackets on
            appropriate ends of the list. In the graphic above,
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;"BIO290"&nbsp;</span>,
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;"BIO483"&nbsp;</span>,

            elements in the <span class="green-text">array named classes</span>,
            and an opening curly bracket marks the beginning of it, while a closing
            curly bracket marks the end.
            Java will only allow you to declare and initialize arrays in a single
            statement, so do not try to separate these procedures. If you try to,
            you will encounter a slew of errors. Now observe the following
            diagram: <br>

            This should help you visually conceptualize an array.
            <span class="bold-text">Elements</span> are items in the array, while
            indices (or <span class="bold-text">indexes</span>) are the positions
            of elements in an array (represented by integers). The ten green boxes
            represent the ten elements of the array, while the number above a given
            element represents the index that would be used to access that element.
            Notice that the index of the first element is 0. This detail is crucial.
            Array indices are offset by 1; your code must accomodate for this. <br>
            Look back at the first image from this section. Lines 5 and 6 contain
            print statements that each access an element at
            <span class="darkblue-text">index 0</span> and
            <span class="pink-text">index 2</span> respectively. The elements have
            been underlined in matching colors to demonstrate which indices from
            the print statements they belong to. To access a specific element from
            an array, you must type the <span class="green-text">name of the array</span>
            followed by its corresponding index placed inside of square brackets.
            Use lines 5 and 6 as an example; try printing another element of your
            own choice from the <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;classes&nbsp;</span>
            array. <br>
            To alter an element in an array, access it by its index and use the
            assignment operator (<span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;=&nbsp;</span>)
            to give it a new value. <br>
            <img src="/mutate_element.png" alt="mutate_element.png"> <br>
            Here is a small project to apply this new skill. Use a "for loop" to set
            every element of your array to an empty String. Then outside of the
            loop, alter your array so that the elements each contain one course in
            your current semester's class schedule. Click <a id="array-problem-btn" href="#">here</a> to
            see a skeleton example that your code should resemble. <br>
            <span id="array-problem">

              <br>
              Lines 5 and 6 have been commented out for your convenience. Now, if
              you look at the test expression of your "for loop", you will notice that
              <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i &lt;= 5&nbsp;</span>. If
              you used <br> <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i &lt;= 6&nbsp;</span>
              instead, then you have fallen victim of OBOE, or off-by-one-error.
              Remember that you must account for the offset of array elements due
              to the 0-based indexing system. <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i &lt;= 6&nbsp;</span> Next, inspect line 9. Notice that
              <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span> is inside of
              the square brackets. This will change the index based upon the value
              of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i&nbsp;</span>, which will
              run from 0 through 5 depending on the iteration. Every time the loop
              iterates, it sets a new element of
              <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;classes&nbsp;</span> to an
              empty String. Below the loop (lines 12-17), each element is assigned
              a new value. Give each element the name of a class you are
              taking. If you would like to confirm that you have successfully rewritten
              the elements of your array, write another loop that prints each element.
              If you so desire, you can use
              <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;i &lt; classes.length&nbsp;</span>
              in lieu of the original test expression.
              <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;.length&nbsp;</span> will
              return the length of an array, which is 6 in this case. The reason
              you do not get a OBOE is because of the use the
              <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;</span> instead
              of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;</span>
              instead, you would get an error. Do not worry about how this works
              yet. This can also be used on <span class="gold-text purple-bg">String</span>s,
              which are simply arrays of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">char</span>s
              (single characters) incidentally. Again, do not be anxious if this
              does not immediately click. One last note: in Java, arrays cannot be
              resized once initialized. Do not hold onto this detail too tightly.
              You will be writing code in JavaScript for this lab. Arrays in JavaScript
              are not of a fixed size.

          <h2>Guided Project</h2>
          <p class="small-font">
            Let's write a short game called "Guess The Number" so we have an example
            to discuss in the <a href="#methods">Methods</a> section. The idea behind
            this program is that a user will be asked guess the value of a randomly
            generated integer between 1 and 50. The program will provide hints to
            the user if he/she guesses wrong (i.e. "Higher!" or "Lower!"). We will
            first write this program without defining any of our own methods. Examples
            from here on out will show variable declaration and initialization combined
            into a single statement. Fewer shall be provided to encourage you to
            solve the problem in your own way.
            <br> <br>
            1. We need to generate a random number. For this, we will have to import
            the Random class and instantiate a new Random object. Note the the usage
            of capitalization to denote that Random is a reference type. We have
            not directly discussed classes, objects, or imports yet, so just follow
            these instructions. Clear all of the code YOU have written just like
            you were instructed to do at the start of the
            <a href="#operators">Operators</a> section. On line 1, add
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;import java.util.Random;&nbsp;</span>
            to import the Random class. Then hit the enter key once to create an
            empty new line. On line 5, add
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;Random rand = new Random();&nbsp;</span>
            to instantiate an object of the Random class. Then declare a variable
            named <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;generateInt&nbsp;</span>
            and initialize it with
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;rand.nextInt(50) + 1&nbsp;</span>.
            The nextInt() method, which belongs to the Random class, generates
            a random number between 0 and the specified maximum value (which was
            50). We assigned this to a variable because we want to save the value
            for later. The value of the maximum number (which we set to 50) that
            is specified is excluded from the range, so we add 1 to the value to
            ensure its inclusion, and also to set the minimum value in the range
            (originally 0) to 1. The number stored in this variable is the number
            which the player needs to guess! <br>
            2. We're going to do something very similar for the Scanner class. Import
            it by adding
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;import java.util.Scanner;&nbsp;</span>
            immediately below your first import statement. Then underneath the line
            in which you instantiated your Random object (AKA your declaration/initialization)
            of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;rand&nbsp;</span>, add
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);&nbsp;</span>
            You now have a Scanner class object named
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;scan&nbsp;</span> set up to
            retrieve user input <br>
            3. We need to prompt the user to guess a number. Add a print statement.
            Then insert
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int guess = scan.nextInt();&nbsp;</span>
            following it. The nextInt() method from the Scanner class will enable
            the user to input an <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int;&nbsp;</span>.
            Once the user hits the "return" key, his/her input will be stored inside
            of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;guess&nbsp;</span>.
            The reason that this variable must be initialized beneath the print
            statement is because code executes sequentially. We want the user to
            be prompted for input before enabling them to type it in... not the
            other way around! By now, your code should look similar to
            <a id="guess-part1-btn" href="#">this</a>: <br>
            <img id="guess-part1" src="/guess_part1.png" alt="guess_part1.png">
            4. We now have the randomly generated number and the user's guess as
            to what it is. We need to think about the possible outcomes.
            If the player correctly guesses the number, the game will end. If the
            player incorrectly guesses a number, then the program will instruct
            the player to guess either higher or lower. Use some conditionals to
            account for these 3 possiblities. You probably used some variation of
            "if statements." <br>
            5. As it is, the game will end immediately, regardless of which path
            the program takes. We need to wrap those conditional blocks inside of
            a loop to continuously run them until the player wins &mdash; at which
            point the loop should exit. This will advance the program's execution
            towards its end. We do not know how many time the loop should iterate,
            so a "for loop" is no longer the best option. Instead, write a "while
            loop" that encapsulates all of your conditional blocks. Declare and
            initialize a boolean named
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;numbersMatch;&nbsp;</span> and
            give it a value of <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;false;&nbsp;</span>.
            Then use <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;!numbersMatch;&nbsp;</span>
            as the test expression for the while loop. The "not" operator says to
            use the opposite value of its operand, so the expression evaluates to
            true because the original value is false. In colloquial english, the
            header of the "while loop" could be understood as saying, "while numbers
            DO NOT match." The "not" operator isn't always intuitive to beginners,
            but appropriate usage will become more obvious with time. If we want
            this loop to exit, we need the value of the test expression to become
            false. Because we want the loop to exit only if the player guesses correctly,
            we shall set
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;numbersMatch;&nbsp;</span>
            to <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;true;</span> inside of the
            body of the conditional block which is accessed when the player correctly
            guesses the randomly generated number. When this happens, the test
            expression will evaluate to false, by virtue of the "not" operator.
            <br>
            6. We still have a problem. As is, the program will only permit the
            player to input their guess once. However, we would like them to guess
            as many times as needed to find the correct number. Translplant
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int guess = scan.nextInt();&nbsp;</span>
            into the body of the "while loop" as its first line. It is this line
            which enables user input. Your program finished program will look something
            like <a id="guess-part2-btn" href="">this</a>.
            <img id="guess-part2" src="/guess_part2.png" alt="guess_part2.png"> <br> <br>

            While your program has all of its desired functionality, it does not
            account for potential errors caused by users. Input validation is important
            in the real world. What if our user tries to enter a
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;String&nbsp;</span> or a
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;double&nbsp;</span> or an number
            outside of 1-50? Sometimes inappropriately formed input can break your
            program or cause errors. We can force users to supply proper input using
            conditionals. For example, you could write an "if statement" with the
            hasNextInt() method from the Scanner class. Look it up. I recommend
            you try to instate some form of validation for the 3 issues listed earler.
            Practice makes perfect.

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p class="small-font">
            A <span class="bold-text">method</span> is a block of code that will
            only execute if called upon. While this term is commonplace in OOP,
            the term <span class="bold-text">function</span> is more frequently
            used in JavaScript. There is a subtle difference in definition, but
            for practical purposes &mdash; yours &mdash; they can be treated synonymously.
            <br>
            Methods increase the reusability, maintainability, and comprehensibility
            of code. In the previous section, you used methods provided by the Java
            API to write your program. In layman's terms, you used methods that
            were predefined and provided for you. Look at the following
            graphic, but do not try to emulate it. We are now going to discuss the
            creation and use of our own methods.
            <img src="/readability.png" alt="readability.png"> <br>
            The code is largely the same, but all of the conditional blocks are gone.
            In the green box, you will see that
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;numbersMatch&nbsp;</span> is
            assigned differently. It is assigned with a method, similar to the way
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;generateInt&nbsp;</span> and
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;guess&nbsp;</span> are. However,
            it is given the value of the method named compare(), which takes in both
            of the variables we just mentioned. If you look at the statement as
            a whole, you may be able to deduce what is happening. The user's guess
            is being compared (hence the name of the method) to the value of the
            randomly generated number, and the variable which dictates the coninuation
            of the loop is set by whether or not the compare() method returns true
            or false. Can you already see how this improves comprehensibility?
            Now, lets look at the code for the compare() method.
            <img src="/compare_method.png" alt="compare_method.png">
            Note that it begins at line 17 (while the previous graphic ends at line
            16). All of this was written in the same file. Line 17 displays the
            method header. Let's break it down step-by-step.
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;public&nbsp;</span> is the access
            modifier. For your purposes, we will overlook this element.
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;static&nbsp;</span>
            denotes that the method is static in nature. Again, we can ignore this.
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;boolean&nbsp;</span> is the
            return type of the method. It indicates that the method will return
            a boolean value.
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;compare&nbsp;</span> is the
            name of the method. <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int guess&nbsp;</span>
            is the first parameter, and
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;int generateInt&nbsp;</span>
            is the second parameter. Parameters are essentially external inputs
            required by a method. The compare() method requires two inputs when used,
            as you may have noticed from the green box in the first graphic.

            <span class="bold-text">Arguments</span> are the specific data you pass
            into a parameter.

            Lines 18-30 are the body. This is where we do any necassary manipulations,
            including those done on our parameters. You may have noticed that our
            conditional blocks were relocated into the method, with some slight
            alterations. The user's guess is taken in through the parameter and
            compared with the randomly generated number which is also taken in through
            the parameter. At the bottom of the method is a return statement which
            must return a boolean value, as the return type in the header indicates.
            It is this value which is given to our variable
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;numbersMatch&nbsp;</span> from
            the first graphic. That is how we control the loop which contains our
            method call to compare(). The idea is that every method must
            boil down into a value of some data type. This is not entirely true, but
            assume it is for explanation's sake. We can then take this value and
            use it for whatever purpose we need. Hence, a method is basically a
            block of code which takes in data (when appropriate) and returns some
            value acquired by manipulating said data. They should be named according
            to their purpose. Look at the graphic below:
            <img src="/method_calls.png" alt="method_calls.png">
            In the context of the program, there is no real purpose for the extra
            method calls to compare(). It just makes it easier to talk about. We
            could have copy/pasted the all of the conditional blocks in place of
            each method call. But doesn't that sound messy? Methods improve readability,
            which improves comprehensibility. Not to mention, the code becomes easily
            reusable. It is much easier to make the 3 method calls than paste the
            corresponding code repeatedly and hope that it works. In this way, the
            code is also more maintainable. If you recognized an error during operation
            of the method, you only need to fix it inside of the method body. This i
            mprovement will then show up everywhere you have made your method call.
            Imagine ten method calls; tt would be significantly more error prone
            and time consuming to directly make that same change to code which was
            copy/pasted 10x.

          <h2>Classes and Objects</h2>
          <p class="small-font">
            Classes and Objects are unfortunately difficult to grasp, and best are
            perhaps best understood through extensive exposure and practice. In
            this section, the concepts will be introduced with little opportunity
            for practice. While mastery is ideal, a superficial understanding
            should suffice for your purposes. A <span class="bold-text">class</span>
            is a blueprint for an <span class="bold-text">object</span>. A class
            is an abstracted representation of some "thing" that forms a template
            for the creation of concrete instances of said "thing." A class has
            attributes &mdash; variables inside of the class which describe the
            relevant qualities and state of the "thing." A class also has methods,
            which describe the behaviors of the "thing." An example may be easier
            to visualize. Suppose you have a class named Person. It may have a name
            attribute, an age atrribute, a height arribute, and whatever other attributes
            are important for objects of this class to have. This class may also
            have methods like a printName() method which prints the name attribute
            given to an object (of the class), or a birthday() method which increments
            the age attribute by 1. A Person class object may be given a name attribute
            of "John" an age "attribute" of 20. The video below breaks down the
            classes and objects in simple terms using a different example. <br>

            It is important to recognize that in some cases, an object of a class
            does not need to be instantiated (AKA created) to use its methods. Under
            such circumstances, you can simply use the class name followed by the
            <span class="gold-text purple-bg">&nbsp;.&nbsp;</span> operator and
            the method name to complete the method call. <br> <br>

            Hopefully by now you have at least a vague appreciation of classes and
            objects. Some other important (and more advanced) topics that you may
            choose to pursue independently are inheritance, encapsulation, and
            abstraction. However, your current level of comprehension should suffice
            for the work done in this lab.
